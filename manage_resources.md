# Managing {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources with Terraform on IBM Cloud
{: #manage_resources}

Use the Terraform CLI to create, update, and delete platform and infrastructure services in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. 
{: shortdesc}

## Provisioning {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources
{: #provision_resources}

To provision {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources, you must describe the state of your resources that you want to achieve in a configuration file.  
{: shortdesc}

Terraform on IBM Cloud configuration files are written by using the [HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/syntax/configuration) or JSON syntax. When you create your configuration file, you must describe the type of resource that you want and the state that you want to achieve for your resource. Terraform on IBM Cloud reads this configuration and creates an execution plan with the steps that were identified to achieve the specified state. If existing resources are found, Terraform on IBM Cloud identifies the necessary steps to update them. 

Before you begin: 
- [Install the Terraform command-line and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-setup_cli#setup_cli).
- [Configure the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in to use your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} credentials](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-setup_cli#install_provider). 

The following example shows how you can configure a virtual server in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} by using JSON syntax. A virtual server is an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure resource that incurs costs. Be sure to review [available plans ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/gen1/infrastructure/provision/vs) before you proceed. 
{: important} 

Looking for other resource types? Find a complete list of supported resource types in the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in reference](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-setup_cli#install_provider). 
{: tip}

1. Create a configuration file that is named `sample.tf` with the following content. Configuration file names must have the `.tf` extension to be found by Terraform on IBM Cloud. Store this file in the same folder that you used to store your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} credentials.

    ```terraform
    resource "ibm_compute_vm_instance" "vm1" {
    hostname = "vm1"
    domain = "example.com"
    os_reference_code = "DEBIAN_8_64"
    datacenter = "dal09"
    network_speed = 10
    hourly_billing = true
    private_network_only = false
    cores = 1
    memory = 1024
    disks = [25]
    local_disk = false
    }
    ```
    {: codeblock}

2. Initialize Terraform on IBM Cloud. 

    ```sh
    terraform init
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:

    ```text
    Initializing provider plugins...

    The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration, so the latest version was installed.

    To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings suggested.

    Terraform on IBM Cloud has been successfully initialized!

    You may now begin working with Terraform on IBM Cloud. Try running "terraform plan" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform on IBM Cloud commands should now work.

    If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform on IBM Cloud, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands detects it and remind you to do so if necessary.
    ```
    {: screen}

3. Generate an Terraform on IBM Cloud execution plan. When you execute this command, Terraform on IBM Cloud validates the syntax of your configuration file and resource definitions against the specifications that are provided by the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in.

    ```sh
    terraform plan
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:

    ```text
    Refreshing Terraform on IBM Cloud state in-memory prior to plan...
    The refreshed state be used to calculate this plan, but not be persisted to local or remote state storage.

   An execution plan has been generated and is shown here.
   Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:

4. Review the execution plan to verify the steps that were identified by Terraform on IBM Cloud to provision the virtual server.  

5. Create your infrastructure resources.  

    ```sh
    terraform apply
    ```
    {: pre} 

    Confirm the creation of infrastructure resources by entering **yes** when prompted.
