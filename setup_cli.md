    mkdir terraform && cd terraform
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Download the [Terraform version](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform){: external} that you want. 
3. Extract the Terraform `zip` file and copy the files to your `terraform` directory. 
4. Set the environment `PATH` variable to your Terraform files.
    ```sh
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/terraform
    ```
    {: pre}

5. Verify that the installation is successful by using a `terraform` command.
    ```sh

    To upgrade your Terraform templates from Terraform old version to new version, see [Upgrading your Terraform version](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-migration-versioncontrol#tf-0.1x-migration).
    {: tip}

6. [Install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in for Terraform](#install_provider).

## Installing the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in
{: #install_provider}

After the Terraform CLI installation is complete, you must set up the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in for Terraform so that you can start working with resources and services in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. 
{: shortdesc}

The setup of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in varies depending on the Terraform version that you want to use. After you complete the set up, you must [configure the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-provider-reference). 

To upgrade the Terraform template from the old version to the latest version, refer to [Upgrading the Terraform template version](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-migrating-terraform-version).
{: important}

### Upgrading to Terraform v0.13.x 
{: #install-provider-v13}

To run your Terraform configuration files with Terraform version 0.13.x and higher, installation of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in for Terraform is not required. Instead, you create a `versions.tf` file and specify the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in version that you want to use. For a list of supported versions, see the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in releases](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/terraform-provider-ibm/releases){: external}.
{: shortdesc}

Create a `versions.tf` file with the following content and store it in your Git repository or the folder where Terraform is set up. In this file, specify the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in version that you want to use with the `version` parameter. 

Syntax:
```terraform
terraform {
    required_providers {
        ibm = {
            source = "IBM-Cloud/ibm"
            version = "<provider version>"       
            }
    }
}
```
{: codeblock}

Example:
```terraform
terraform {
    required_providers {
        ibm = {
            source = "IBM-Cloud/ibm"
            version = ">= 1.38.1"
        }
    }
}
```
{: codeblock} 

### Specifying Terraform version constraints
{: #terraform-operators}

Terraform supports `version` constraints to specify the range of acceptable versions to initialize. The version syntax format is specified as `<MAJOR_VERSION>.<MINOR_VERSION>.<PATCH>`. You can modify the version constraint operator in this example by using combination of the [supported operators in Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/version-constraints#version-constraint-syntax){: external}. Some of the constraints are shown as an example. 

|Operator|Description|
|-------|---------|
| `= (or no operator)`| Allows only extract version number. You cannot combine with other conditions. For example, `1.31.0`.|
| `!=` | Excludes an exact version number. For example, `!=1.39.0`.|
| `>, >=, <, <=` | Compares against a specified version, allows version for which the comparison is true. `Greater-than` requests newer version, and `less-than` requests older versions. For example, `>= 1.30.0 < 2.0.0`.|
| `~>` | Allows only the rightmost version component to increment. For example, `~> 1.30.0` allows new patch releases within a specific minor patch releases like `1.30.1, 1.30.2, 1.30.3`, but not `1.31.0` release.|
{: caption="Terraform template version operators"}

If you are using Terraform on IBM Cloud modules, you must add a `versions.tf` file in all the module folders. You can refer the Terraform provider block from the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest){: external}.
{: note}

### Upgrading Terraform v0.12.x and earlier
{: #install-provider-v12}

Complete the following steps to install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} provider plug-in on your local machine.
{: shortdesc}

1. Download the latest version of the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} provider plug-in](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/terraform-provider-ibm/releases){: external}.
2. Extract the `zip` file and retrieve the files.
3. Create a hidden `plugins` folder on your local machine.
    ```sh
    mkdir -p $HOME/.terraform.d/plugins
    ```
    {: pre}

4. Move the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in into your `plugins` folder.
    ```sh
    mv $HOME/<DOWNLOAD_FOLDER_NAME>/terraform-provider-ibm* $HOME/.terraform.d/plugins
    ```
    {: pre}

5. Navigate to your `plugins` folder and verify that the installation is complete.
    ```sh
    cd $HOME/.terraform.d/plugins && ./terraform-provider-ibm_*
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output: 
    ```text
    2021/04/16 17:00:39 IBM Cloud Provider version 1.23.1  
    This binary is a plugin. These are not meant to be executed directly.
    Please execute the program that consumes these plugins, which will load any plugins automatically
    ```
    {: screen}

6. [Configure the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-provider-reference). To view the list of supported {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider versions, refer to [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in releases](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/terraform-provider-ibm/releases){: external}.
